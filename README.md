### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/diamond-player.git
    cd diamond-player
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:

### Running the Application

To run the application in development mode, which starts the Next.js server and the Electron app, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will open the desktop application window.

## üì¶ Building the Application

This project uses [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) to package the application. You can add a script to your `package.json` to make building easier.

1.  Add the following to the `scripts` section in `package.json`:

    ```json
    "dist": "next build && electron-builder"
    ```

2.  Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run dist
    ```
    This will create a distributable package for your operating system in a new `dist` folder.
